# Gamification Impact on Students' Final Exam Scores

## Overview

This project explores the impact of gamification on students' final exam scores. The goal is to create a predictive model that estimates the final exam scores based on the practice exam scores and whether a student uses gamification.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gianinamariapetrascu/gamification-students-grades). It includes information on practice exam scores, final exam scores, and whether students used gamification.
